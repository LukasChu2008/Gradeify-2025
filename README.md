# Gradeify

Gradeify is a web application that helps students plan and track their academic progress more effectively.  
Using the StudentVUE API, Gradeify allows students to log in, view their grades, and simulate "what-if" scenarios—such as entering an expected score for an assignment or exam to instantly see how it affects their overall grade.  

## 🚀 Features
- Secure login with StudentVUE  
- Display of current grades by class  
- "What-if" calculator to test how future scores will impact overall grades  
- Future goal: calculate the minimum score needed to reach a target grade  
- Future goal: provide subject-specific study resources
